          TRACEY MCTAGUE is a visual artist and writer born and raised in
          Brooklyn, N.Y. She utilizes a language informed by ecofeminism and the
          oral traditions of the seanchaí. Gathering from cross-cultural
          cosmogonic myths from our collective unconscious, she harnesses the
          micro protests of our ancestral mycorrhizae as weaponized forms of
          macro survival.

          McTague received her education in fine art and film at Parsons and The
          New School. She worked for Michael Moore on The Awful Truth, harassing
          CEOs via the art department. She has also worked for the Association
          for Cultural Equity and in the Alan Lomax archive, helping to preserve
          and prepare his vast collection of music for the Library of Congress
          while contacting all living descendants for ancestral reparations for
          everything we call music. She works for the Irish peacemaker Prof.
          Padraig O’Malley, who specializes in the problems of divided societies
          such as South Africa and Northern Ireland. She also created a photo
          project for an 11-nation secular collective seeking to help empower
          European Muslim youth through artistic self-expression and
          socio-political documentation.

          Composed in three sections – “Thirst,” “Ancestor Midden,” and
          “Contagion” —Tracey McTague’s new volume of poems hinges on an
          exploration of prophecy and vision, and the correlations of these with
          history, science, magic, and (mis-)fortune.

          "Like the sky just before a storm—bruisy and electric, angry and
          beautiful—Tracey McTague’s poems awe. The poems present a diorama
          world with a secret mythology—animals are never just animals;
          goddesses are real, are women—the kind who are angry and tired; not
          menstruating but on the rag. Time slips and stutters; language soars
          and dips, doubling back on itself. It’s a song or it’s a hymn or it’s
          a curse, whatever, it’s too late—here you are. Something’s always
          about to happen in Marginal Utility. When you squint one eye and peer
          through the aperture, you won’t see the same thing every time. This
          book, diorama of treasures, is a shifting landscape of wonder and
          weirdness that always changes, richer and more exciting each time you
          look." -Lauren Ireland

          "Tracey McTague treats words as marvels of nature and concentrates
          them. She writes most lines as independent units in a collage poetics,
          yet the self-aware passions of her unconscious conjure a pagan
          abandon. She sees beyond the senses and beyond sentences. A
          pent-up-ness sweeps away grammar. Many of her lines read like
          13-stroke Chinese characters in translation. Her clipped lyricism
          suits a scale that is galaxy big, including cigarettes and a thong.
          Primal, not primitive. Marginal Utility is a safe ride with a
          dangerous driver, and you’ll be left excited." -John Godfrey

          "Tracey McTague’s poetry is sensual, visceral, vibrant, playful,
          arresting, stark, sometimes shocking or haunting, and always
          uplifting. I love this book!" -John S. Hall
