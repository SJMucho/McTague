          TRACEY MCTAGUE is a visual artist and writer born and raised in
          Brooklyn, N.Y. She utilizes a language informed by ecofeminism and the
          oral traditions of the seanchaí. Gathering from cross-cultural
          cosmogonic myths from our collective unconscious, she harnesses the
          micro protests of our ancestral mycorrhizae as weaponized forms of
          macro survival.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          McTague received her education in fine art and film at Parsons and The
          New School. She worked for Michael Moore on The Awful Truth, harassing
          CEOs via the art department. She has also worked for the Association
          for Cultural Equity and in the Alan Lomax archive, helping to preserve
          and prepare his vast collection of music for the Library of Congress
          while contacting all living descendants for ancestral reparations for
          everything we call music. She works for the Irish peacemaker Prof.
          Padraig O’Malley, who specializes in the problems of divided societies
          such as South Africa and Northern Ireland. She also created a photo
          project for an 11-nation secular collective seeking to help empower
          European Muslim youth through artistic self-expression and
          socio-political documentation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          She was the art director of Lungfull! Magazine for 12 years, and
          hosted the Battle Hill Reading Series for five. Her art, essays,
          reviews, and poetry have been in The Brooklyn Rail, The Poetry Project
          Newsletter, and The Poetry Foundation’s Harriet Books, among others.
          She is author of Super Natural and Marginal Utility, both published by
          New Orleans’ Trembling Pillow Press.
