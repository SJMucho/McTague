        TRACEY MCTAGUE is a visual artist and writer born and raised in
        Brooklyn, N.Y. She utilizes a language informed by ecofeminism and the
        oral traditions of the seanchaí. Gathering from cross-cultural
        cosmogonic myths from our collective unconscious, she harnesses the
        micro protests of our ancestral mycorrhizae as weaponized forms of macro
        survival.

        McTague received her education in fine art and film at Parsons and The
        New School. She worked for Michael Moore on The Awful Truth, harassing
        CEOs via the art department. She has also worked for the Association for
        Cultural Equity and in the Alan Lomax archive, helping to preserve and
        prepare his vast collection of music for the Library of Congress while
        contacting all living descendants for ancestral reparations for
        everything we call music. She works for the Irish peacemaker Prof.
        Padraig O’Malley, who specializes in the problems of divided societies
        such as South Africa and Northern Ireland. She also created a photo
        project for an 11-nation secular collective seeking to help empower
        European Muslim youth through artistic self-expression and
        socio-political documentation.
